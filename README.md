# answertainty
Simple Arduino Nano based pseudorandom Eurorack module

Answertainty creates pseudorandom signals.
The "Gate" output changes to 0v or 5v randomly. The further the pot is turned right, the more frequently it changes state.
The "Slow" outputs create slowly evolving continuous control voltages, from about -5v to +5v. The further the pot is turned right, the faster it evolves.
The "Fast" output does the same as the "Slow" outputs, but responds to the pot in the opposite direction.
